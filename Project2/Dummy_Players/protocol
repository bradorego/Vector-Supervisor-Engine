NETWORK PROTOCOL
--------------------

First, all clients are asked to identify with a request:

IDENTIFY?

Then, after all have identified, the game turn orders are
decided and printed in the format:

GAME <number>: <north player> <east> <south> <west>

After which the first game starts.  Each game starts with:

BEGIN GAME <game number>: <north player> <e> <s> <w>

Each game starts with:

BEGIN ROUND <round>
COORD: <x> <y>
TURN ORDER: <north player> <e> <s> <w>

When it comes time for a given client to state its direction, it is asked:

DIRECTION?

To which it replies:

DIRECTION: <one of N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW> \r\n

The server broadcasts the choice of the current player immediately after each player responds with its direction in the:.

<one of N, E, S, W> CHOOSES: <one of N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW>

Similarly, when magnitude is requested, the client is asked:

MAGNITUDE?

To which it replies:

MAGNITUDE: <magnitude> \r\n

Then, the magnitude choices of all the players is given in the following form at the same time:

MAGNITUDES: <magnitude of north> <e> <s> <w>

After each round, the scores are announced in the form:

SCORES(NESW): <north score> <e> <s> <w>

Should a player be disqualified at any time, their disqualification
will be announced:

DISQUALIFICATION: <first disqualified player (identified by N, E, S or W)> <second disqualified player> ...

After a disqualification or the end of a round, the next
round starts in a similar fashion.  The same holds for each game
as well.

At the end of each game, the game winners and the current tournament scores are announced as follows:

WINNER: <winning team or tie, should the game be a tie>
TOURNAMENT SCORES: <player 1>=<score> <player 2>=score ...

After a game has ended, either a new game begins or the program finishes.
